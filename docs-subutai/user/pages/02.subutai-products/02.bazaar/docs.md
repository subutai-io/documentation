Subutai Bazaar is the P2P cloud market and social environment for the Subutai Platform. These documentation pages have instructions on what it can do and how. Through the Bazaar users can sell, barter, share or hire computational resources and server applications from other users.

The Bazaar congregates Peers provided by the community of users running Subutai PeerOS. Anyone can create Environments on these Peers, based on diverse templates that range from simple containerized linux servers to more complex applications such as Cassandra, Apache, Wordpress, Jetty or even a full-fledged GNU-Linux Operating System with a Graphic User Interface.
