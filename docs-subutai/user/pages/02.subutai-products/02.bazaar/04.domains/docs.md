You can point domain names to your environments and containers. For now the only available option are subdomains of ‘envs.subutai.cloud’, but in the future that will be expanded. You may add your own subdomain by clicking “Add new” and checking the availability of your desired subdomain. After the environment is created, you need to set up a container port mapping. See more detailed information in the [documentation pages for Environments](../environments).
