An **Environment** is a logically grouped set of containers distributed
across one or multiple peers that share the same network (they belong to
the same p2p swarm - see more on
[*p2p*](https://github.com/subutai-io/p2p/)). An Environment can host a
number of applications.

Templates
---------

Environments are based on templates - basic software packages that
provide a set of functionalities and can be extended to whatever you may
need. For instance, there are templates that allow you to deploy a
Debian server image to a Subutai Environment. You can use the templates
already available in the PeerOS and Bazaar, or even create your own:

Check how to create Templates (from the [*command-line
interface*](https://github.com/subutai-io/base/wiki/Create-Templates-from-CLI)
or the [*Subutai
Console*](https://github.com/subutai-io/base/wiki/Create-Templates-from-Console)).
